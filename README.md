# Tree Style Notes for Obsidian

View notes and their links in a tree style structure to easily discover linked ideas.



One of the greatest parts of Obsidian is the ability to link together ideas, and then see how they connect in the graph. When combined with the Zettelkasten method, this can lead to the generation of new insights and ideas. 

But what I always found frustrating was that there wasn't a clearer overview of all of the notes and how they are connected. The graph view, ecscpecially when you have a lot of notes, can become difficult to navigate, and to see the links between notes that make this way of taking notes so valuable. 

So I created Tree Style Notes, a view for Obsidian where you can see all your notes, and click on them to see the notes they link to, or which link to them.

## The Method

This plugin is created around the idea of using links instead of tags.
